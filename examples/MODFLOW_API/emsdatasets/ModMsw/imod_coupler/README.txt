This folder should contain the artifacts of the iMOD-5.2 release,
specifically we use the following dlls to run MetaSWAP:

fmpich2.dll
MetaSWAP.dll
mpich2mpi.dll
mpich2nemesis.dll
TRANSOL.dll

the MODFLOW version we have used for the results presented in the paper is not from that release but the updated version 6.2.2:

libmf6.dll

(See the Jupyter notebook on how to get them)
